# SAKUGUESSR Game

### BASIC OVERVIEW

In this game, you are presented with a random clip of animation and a text box.
If the basic name of the anime that the clip comes from is entered, then you are awarded full points, with bonus points for a perfectly specific name. Elsewise, multiple choices are shown for partial credit. That credit is reduced once again for the first wrong multiple choice answer, and after the second, that's three strikes, ending the guessing for that clip, adding a strike for the current game, and moving on to the next clip. After three strikes in one game, the score and strikes are reset, a high score is updated if applicable, and a new game begins.

### ALTERNATE INPUTS

The submit button will submit the input as expected for both phases, but alternatively, users may simply press the enter key to submit a text entry or press a number key to automatically choose and enter a corresponding multiple choice option for speed.
