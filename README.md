#**SAKUGUESSR Game**

###**BASIC OVERVIEW**
In this game, you are presented with a random clip of animation and a text box.
If the basic name of the anime that the clip comes from is entered, then you are awarded full points, with bonus points for a perfectly specific name. Elsewise, multiple choices are shown for partial credit. That credit is reduced once again for the first wrong multiple choice answer, and after the second, that's three strikes, ending the guessing for that clip, adding a strike for the current game, and moving on to the next clip. After three strikes in one game, the score and strikes are reset, a high score is updated if applicable, and a new game begins.

###**ALTERNATE INPUTS**
The submit button will submit the input as expected for both phases, but alternatively, users may simply press the enter key to submit a text entry or press a number key to automatically choose and enter a corresponding multiple choice option for speed.






IDEAS

Series or Animator

Timed, three* strikes, or free play with a ratio at the end

Click start and a random clip shows up and plays
        Starts function that gets a random clip, then filters out certain criteria until a valid clip, then displays that
            idk how to do this
        Maybe does a grid of random clips and you pick which one matches a prompt


First, there's an option to manually enter in the name of the series

If it's right, advance with two points

If not, four series names are presented for multiple choice. One is the 
answer, and the other three are randomly selected.

If it's right, advance with one point. 

If not, no points

Either way, answer is revealed with a link to the tag
    Maybe with a few other examples from the tag
    Maybe with a mal score attached

At the end, score is shown and added to a leaderboard
    Maybe with a review of answers
