IDEAS

Series or Animator

Timed, three* strikes, or free play with a ratio at the end

Click start and a random clip shows up and plays
        Starts function that gets a random clip, then filters out certain criteria until a valid clip, then displays that
            idk how to do this
        Maybe does a grid of random clips and you pick which one matches a prompt


First, there's an option to manually enter in the name of the series

If it's right, advance with two points

If not, four series names are presented for multiple choice. One is the 
answer, and the other three are randomly selected.

If it's right, advance with one point. 

If not, no points

Either way, answer is revealed with a link to the tag
    Maybe with a few other examples from the tag
    Maybe with a mal score attached

At the end, score is shown and added to a leaderboard
    Maybe with a review of answers
